# Welcome to Pumki UI ðŸ¥³

**Pumki UI** is a modern, production-ready UI library built to streamline frontend development. It consolidates components, animations, design tokens, and templates into a single, consistent systemâ€”so you can focus on building, not configuring.

Whether you're building internal dashboards, SaaS products, landing pages, or tools, Pumki UI gives you a solid foundation to move faster with fewer dependencies.

<Callout>Ship interfaces with one library, not ten.</Callout>

## Why Pumki UI

- **All-in-one architecture**  
  UI components, layouts, animations, and design tokens included out of the box.

- **Minimal setup, maximum output**  
  Pre-configured defaults mean less boilerplate and more building.

- **Type-safe and predictable**  
  Built with TypeScript for strong developer confidence and better DX.

- **Modern aesthetics by default**  
  Consistent, elegant components designed for real-world use.

- **Optional Tailwind support**  
  Use our built-in tokens, or integrate seamlessly with your existing Tailwind setup.
